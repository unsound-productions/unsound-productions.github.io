###ANDY VOTEL PRESENTS: KLEKSPLOITATION

A homage to Pan Kleks, a Polish trilogy of films for children from the 1980s, loved by Poland's children from that era. Electronic musician, DJ and music producer Andy Votel draws on images, music and sound from the original films, selecting and subverting, to coax their darker side to the surface and create something wholly original, unsettling and - at times - weirdly humorous.

The Pan Kleks trilogy was scored by Andrzej Korzyński, a Warsaw composer whose unearthed catalogue Votel is currently releasing on his Finders Keepers label, including music written for Andrzej Żuławski's incredible Possesion.

Kleksploitation was commissioned by Unsound in 2012, and presented at The Barbican in London in 2013.
